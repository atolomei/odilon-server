
RAID ZERO FAQ
-------------

ADDING DISKS

If I add a new disk is it necessary to restart the server ?
----------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

If I add a new disk will the server be operational immediately  ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No. The server will start a process to move some of the objects
from the existing disks to the new disk. 
This process is executed in parallel by multiple threads.
Only after completing it the server will be operational.


Can the server continue to work if a disk is lost ?
--------------------------------------------------- 
The server will work after restart but the objects stored on the lost disk are gone. 
RAID 0 is a configuration that has no redundancy.
